How to run the code?

After compiling the file the user should input the arguments in the command line (example: ./mazeGen 5 5). 
The first parameter is the number of rows in the maze, the sceond is the number of columns.
If the thrid parameter is also given the maze will take it as the seed for generating random numbers.

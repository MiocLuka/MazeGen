What does the program do?

It creates a randomly generated maze each time depending on the parameters.
The maze will always have exactly one solution.
The path is marked by the dots inside of each cell of the maze.
The maze is solved from the top left to the bottom right.



How to run the code?

After compiling the file the user should input the arguments in the command line (example: ./mazeGen 5 5). 
The first parameter is the number of rows in the maze, the sceond is the number of columns.
If the thrid parameter is also given the maze will take it as the seed for generating random numbers.
